import project

project.print_hello()
# This is a simple script that imports the project module and calls the print_hello function.
# It demonstrates how to use the module in a standalone script.
# The project module should be in the same directory or in the Python path for this to work.
# Make sure to run this script in an environment where the project module is accessible.
